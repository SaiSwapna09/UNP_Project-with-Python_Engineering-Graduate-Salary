# UNP_Project-with-Python_Engineering-Graduate-Salary

Dataset Name: Enginneering Graduate Student Salary Dataset

Objective of the Project:
The goal of this project is to predict the salaries of engineering students using machine learning models, 
aiding in career planning and decision-making.

Project Description:
This project involves the use of a dataset containing 34 variables and 2998 records related to engineering students, including academic performance, AMCAT scores, and personal traits. Key steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Extensive preprocessing was performed, including grouping and encoding categorical data, handling missing values, and deriving meaningful features like average AMCAT scores.

Conclusion:
The Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance among the tested algorithms, achieving the highest accuracy. This model provides valuable insights into the factors influencing student salaries and supports informed decision-making in career development.
